# sample__FRDM_MCXA153_GPIO_and_SPI_freq_test

## What is this? 

One day, an old mate asked me,  
"Is there a microcontroller that can run SPI at 25MHz or toggle GPIO at 40MHz?"  
Well, I figured out from the datasheet that the MCX-A153 might do the job, but I properly tested it out ;) 

These are ample code projects for testing FRDM-MCXA153 GPIO toggle speed and SPI maximum frequency. It runs on MCUXpresso with FRDM-MCXA153. 

## How to use this?
